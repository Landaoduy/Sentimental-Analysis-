# Sentimental Analysis
* A Machine Learning project that analyzes IMDB movie reviews to classify sentiment as positive or negative using various tree-based models and TF-IDF vectorization

## Overview

  * **Definition of the tasks / challenge**: The project aims to perform binary sentiment classification on IMDB movie reviews, categorizing them as either positive or negative based on the review text. This involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to understand and classify the emotional tone of movie reviews.
    
  * **My approach**: The solution employs a comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline including HTML tag removal, contraction expansion, emoji removal, and lemmatization. The processed text is then vectorized using TF-IDF, and multiple tree-based models are compared for classification performance.
    
  * **Summary of the performance achieved**: Based on the Accuracy Score, out models achieved the following performance on test set:
      * XGBoost: Best overall performance with accuracy score of 0.847
      * Random Forest: Close second with accuracy score of 0.842
      * AdaBoost: Strong performance with accuracy score of 0.821
      * Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting:  Baseline model with reasonable performance with accuracy score of 0.714 and 0.796

## Summary of Workdone

### Data

* Data:
  * Type: Text data (movie reviews) with binary sentiment labels
    
  * Size: Near 50,000 movie reviews
    
  * Instances (Train, Test Split): 80% Training (~ 40,000 reviews), 20% testing (~ 10,000 reviews)

#### Preprocessing / Clean up

* 1. HTML tag removal using BeautifulSoup
* 2. Contraction expansion (e.g., "don't" â†’ "do not")
* 3. Emoji removal
* 4. URL removal
* 5. Punctuation removal and text lowercase conversion
* 6. Stopword removal
* 7. Lemmatization using WordNet
* 8. TF-IDF vectorization (10,000 features)

#### Data Visualization

Show a few visualization of the data and say a few words about what you see.

### Problem Formulation

* **Input**: Text data (movie reviews)
  * Raw text containing HTML tags, contractions, emojis, URLs, and various text artifacts
  * Variable length reviews (ranging from few words to several paragraphs)
    
* **Output**: Binary sentiment classification
  * Postivive: 1
  * Negative: 0

* **Models**:
  * **Decision Tree Classifier**:
    * Chosen for its interpretability and ability to handle non-linear relationships
    * Simple baseline model for comparison

  * **Random Forest**:
    * Ensemble method to reduce overfitting of decision trees
    * Better generalization through bagging
    * Good at handling high-dimensional sparse data from TF-IDF

  * **AdaBoost**:
    * Focuses on misclassified samples through boosting
    * Helps in handling difficult-to-classify reviews
    * Reduces bias in the model

  * **XGBoost**:
    * Efficient handling of sparse matrices
    * Better regularization to prevent overfitting
